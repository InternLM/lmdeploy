# Introduction

LMDeploy is a toolkit for compressing, deploying, and serving LLM, developed by the [MMRazor](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrazor) and [MMDeploy](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdeploy) teams. It has the following core features:

- **Efficient Inference**: LMDeploy delivers up to 1.8x higher request throughput than vLLM, by introducing key features like persistent batch(a.k.a. continuous batching), blocked KV cache, dynamic split&fuse, tensor parallelism, high-performance CUDA kernels and so on.

- **Effective Quantization**: LMDeploy supports weight-only and k/v quantization, and the 4-bit inference performance is 2.4x higher than FP16. The quantization quality has been confirmed via OpenCompass evaluation.

- **Effortless Distribution Server**: Leveraging the request distribution service, LMDeploy facilitates an easy and efficient deployment of multi-model services across multiple machines and cards.

- **Interactive Inference Mode**: By caching the k/v of attention during multi-round dialogue processes, the engine remembers dialogue history, thus avoiding repetitive processing of historical sessions.

LMDeploy has developed two inference engines - [TurboMind](./docs/en/inference/turbomind.md) and [PyTorch](./docs/en/inference/pytorch.md), each with a different focus. The former strives for ultimate optimization of inference performance, while the latter, developed purely in Python, aims to decrease the barriers for developers.

They differ in the types of supported models and the inference data type. Please refer to [this table](./docs/en/supported_models/supported_models.md) for each engine's capability and choose the proper one that best fits your actual needs.

# Quick Start

## Installation

Install lmdeploy with pip ( python 3.8+) or [from source](./docs/en/build.md)

```shell
pip install lmdeploy
```

The default prebuilt package is compiled on CUDA 11.8. However, if CUDA 12+ is required, you can install lmdeploy by:

```shell
export LMDEPLOY_VERSION=0.2.0
export PYTHON_VERSION=38
pip install https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy/releases/download/v${LMDEPLOY_VERSION}/lmdeploy-${LMDEPLOY_VERSION}-cp${PYTHON_VERSION}-cp${PYTHON_VERSION}-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
```

## Offline Batch Inference

```python
import lmdeploy
pipe = lmdeploy.pipeline("internlm/internlm-chat-7b")
response = pipe(["Hi, pls intro yourself", "Shanghai is"])
print(response)
```

> \[!NOTE\]
> By default, LMDeploy downloads model from HuggingFace. If you would like to use models from ModelScope, please install ModelScope by `pip install modelscope` and set the environment variable:
>
> `export LMDEPLOY_USE_MODELSCOPE=True`

For more information about inference pipeline, please refer to [here](./docs/en/inference/pipeline.md).
