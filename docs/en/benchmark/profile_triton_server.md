# Triton Inference Server Performance Test Method

Triton Inference Server (TIS) is another serving method supported by LMDeploy besides from api_server. Its performance testing methods and metrics are similar to those of [api_server](./profile_api_server.md).

The evaluation script is `profile_serving.py`. Before running it, please install the lmdeploy precompiled package, download the evaluation script and the test dataset:

```shell
pip install 'lmdeploy[serve]>=0.1.0a1'
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy
cd lmdeploy/benchmark
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered/resolve/main/ShareGPT_V3_unfiltered_cleaned_split.json
```

During performance test, a specific model needs to be inputted. We recommend converting the model into turbomind format via `lmdeploy convert`, then proceed with testing.
The reason is to conveniently adjust the parameters of the inference engine in order to achieve better performance, such as batch size (max_batch_size), K/V cache size (max_cache_entry_count), etc. For detailed explanations of these parameters, please refer to [here](../turbomind_config.md).

In the following sections, we assume the model is in turbomind format.

## Metrics

LMDeploy records the performance metrics like first token latency, token throughput (tokens/s) and request throughput (RPM)

`first_token_latency` is only reported in the case of streaming inference.

The formula for calculating `token throughput` is:

$$
TokenThroughput=Number\\ of\\ generated\\ tokens/TotalTime
$$

And the formula for calculating `request throughput` is:

$$
RPM(request\\ per\\ minute)=Number\\ of\\ prompts/TotalTime * 60
$$

Total time includes prefill time.

## Example

We take `internlm-7b` as an example. The entire benchmark procedure is:

```shell
pip install 'lmdeploy[serve]>=0.1.0a1'
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy
cd lmdeploy/benchmark
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered/resolve/main/ShareGPT_V3_unfiltered_cleaned_split.json

# get internlm-7b from huggingface and convert it to turbomind format
lmdeploy convert internlm internlm/internlm-7b --dst-path ./internlm-7b

# launch server
bash ./internlm-7b/service_docker_up.sh

# open another terminal and run the following command in the directory `lmdeploy/benchmark`
python3 ./profile_serving 0.0.0.0:33337 ./internlm-7b/triton_models/tokenizer ./ShareGPT_V3_unfiltered_cleaned_split.json
```

## Command details

```shell
python3 profile_serving.py <server_addr> <tokenizer_path> <dataset> <optional arguments>
```

The required parameters are:

- `server_addr`

  The address of api_server with format `{server_ip}:{server_port}`

- `tokenizer_path`

  The path of the tokenizer model, which is used to encode the dataset to get the token size of prompts and responses

- `dataset`

  The path of the downloaded dataset

Optional arguments are listed as below:

- `--concurrency`

  It represents the number of request threads with default value 32. Requests of concurrent threads will be batched by the inference engine.
  It is recommended that `concurrency` does not exceed the `max_batch_size` in `config.ini`, nor should it exceed the number of inference instances in `triton_models`.
  Otherwise, the excess requests will wait in the inference queue.

  The configuration item for the number of inference instances is `instance_group`, which is located in the file `{model_path}/triton_models/interactive/config.pbtxt`, and the default is 48.

- `--num-prompts`

  The number of sampled prompts from dataset to process. The default is 1000. It is suggested 2000 when `concurrency >= 64`

- `--top_k`„ÄÅ`--top_p` and `--temperature`

  They are used to sample the generated token_id.

- `--stream_output`

  Indicator for streaming output. The default is `True`.

- `--csv`

  The path of a csv file to save the result with default value `../profile_tis.csv`

- `--seed`

  It is the seed used in sampling prompts from dataset with default value 0.
